# OOP

#Abstraction:
Abstraction is an OOP concept that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant information to the user. It allows you to work with high-level ideas without worrying about the underlying details.

Key Points:
Hides complexity and shows only essential features.
Helps in focusing on what an object does, rather than how it does it.
Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces (classes with pure virtual functions).
