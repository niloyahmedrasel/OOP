Encapsulation in C++ (Simple Definition)
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the data inside a class and only allowing access to it through public methods (functions). This helps protect the data and makes sure it can only be changed in controlled ways.

Example:
Private variables hold the data, so they canâ€™t be accessed directly.
Public methods like getters and setters are used to read or change the data.
Encapsulation makes your code more secure and easier to maintain!
