#Definations of types of inheritence

1.Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from only one base class.
2.Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class inherits from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
3.Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
4.Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
5.Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., single, multiple, hierarchical).
6.Multipath Inheritance: A derived class inherits from two or more classes that share a common base class, leading to inheritance paths that converge.
